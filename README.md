Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will automatically reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about running tests for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

#### `npm run eject`

*Note:* This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

bash
nodemon index.js
This command runs the server on http://localhost:8080.
